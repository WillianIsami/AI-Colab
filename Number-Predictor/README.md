# Number Predictor

This project is aimed at building a number prediction model using image recognition techniques. The model is built using matplotlib.pyplot, numpy and tensorflow libraries in Python.

The project uses the MNIST dataset which contains thousands of images digits ranging from 0 to 9.

Overall, the project demonstrates the use of image recognition techniques and neural networks models to predict numbers from images with high accuracy.
